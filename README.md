# FuzzyTrees
FuzzyTrees is a machine-learning application built in Python and Hex that combines fuzzy-matching techniques with a random forest classifier to do approximate matches on records from separate tables/data sources. In the original use case, this was to find duplicate vet practice records that were flowing in through DBT from vso and vss data sources all the way into practice_online_details in the core layer. Duplicate records within our infrastructure can compromise the integrity of downstream reporting and analytics, which is why it's important to develop tools/strategies to avoid and handle duplicates.

For all pairs of records in two tables, FuzzyTrees computes similarity metrics on shared fields (name, city, address, zip) using the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance'>Levenshtein distance</a> and <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance'>Jaro-Winkler distance</a>. These similarity metrics are 
used for feature engineering for the random forest classifier algorithm. Scanning over duplicate VSS practices, FuzzyTrees finds the best approximate match in the table of VSO practices--providing a base mapping for systematic deduplication.
