# FuzzyTrees
FuzzyTrees is a machine-learning application built in Python and Hex that combines fuzzy-matching techniques with a random forest classifier to do approximate matches on records from separate tables/data sources. In the original use case, this was to identify duplicate vet practice records in the VS DBT project for de-duplication.
